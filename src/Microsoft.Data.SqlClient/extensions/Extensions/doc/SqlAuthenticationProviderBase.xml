      <param name="authenticationMethod">The authentication method.</param>
      <summary>This method is called immediately before the provider is removed from the SQL authentication provider registry.</summary>
      <remarks>
        For example, this method is called when a different provider with the same authentication method overrides this provider in the SQL authentication provider registry. Avoid performing long-waiting task in this method, since it can block other threads from accessing the provider registry.
