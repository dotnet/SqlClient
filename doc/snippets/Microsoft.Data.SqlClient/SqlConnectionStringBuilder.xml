        <SqlConnectionStringBuilder>
            <summary>Provides a simple way to create and manage the contents of connection strings used by the <see cref="T:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection" /> class.</summary>

## Remarks  
 The connection string builder lets developers programmatically create syntactically correct connection strings, and parse and rebuild existing connection strings, using properties and methods of the class. The connection string builder provides strongly typed properties corresponding to the known key/value pairs allowed by SQL Server. Developers needing to create connection strings as part of applications can use the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> class to build and modify connection strings. The class also makes it easy to manage connection strings stored in an application configuration file.  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> performs checks for valid key/value pairs. Therefore, you cannot use this class to create invalid connection strings; trying to add invalid pairs will throw an exception. The class maintains a fixed collection of synonyms and can translate from a synonym to the corresponding well-known key name.  
  
 For example, when you use the **Item** property to retrieve a value, you can specify a string that contains any synonym for the key you need. For example, you can specify "Network Address", "addr", or any other acceptable synonym for this key within a connection string when you use any member that requires a string that contains the key name, such as the **Item** property or the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder.Remove%2A> method. See the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.ConnectionString%2A> property for a full list of acceptable synonyms.  
  
 The **Item** property handles tries to insert malicious entries. For example, the following code, using the default Item property (the indexer, in C#) correctly escapes the nested key/value pair:  
  
```vb  
Dim builder As New Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder  
builder("Data Source") = "(local)"  
builder("Integrated Security") = True  
builder("Initial Catalog") = "AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad"  
Console.WriteLine(builder.ConnectionString)  
```  
  
```csharp  
Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder =  
  new Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder();  
builder["Data Source"] = "(local)";  
builder["Integrated Security"] = true;  
builder["Initial Catalog"] = "AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad";  
Console.WriteLine(builder.ConnectionString);  
  
```  
  
 The result is the following connection string that handles the invalid value in a safe manner:  
  
```  
Source=(local);Initial Catalog="AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad";  
Integrated Security=True  
```  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following console application builds connection strings for a SQL Server database. The code uses a <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> class to create the connection string, and then passes the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder.ConnectionString%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> instance to the constructor of the connection class. The example also parses an existing connection string and demonstrates various ways of manipulating the connection string's contents.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This example includes a password to demonstrate how <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> works with connection strings. In your applications, we recommend that you use Windows Authentication. If you must use a password, do not include a hard-coded password in your application.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> class provides a fixed internal collection of key/value pairs. Even if you supply only a small subset of the possible connection string values in the constructor, the object always provides default values for each key/value pair. When the `ConnectionString` property of the object is retrieved, the string contains only key/value pairs in which the value is not the default value for the item.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example supplies a simple SQL Server connection string in the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> object's constructor, and then iterates through all the key/value pairs within the object. Note that the collection provides default values for each item. Also note that the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> class converts synonyms for the well-known keys so that they are consistent with the well-known names.

In your applications, we recommend that you use Windows Authentication. If you must use a password, do not include a hard-coded password in your application.

            <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 This property corresponds to the "AttachDBFilename", "extended properties", and "initial file name" keys within the connection string.  
  
 `AttachDBFilename` is only supported for primary data files with an .mdf extension.  

 If the value of the AttachDBFileName key is specified in the connection string, the database is attached and becomes the default database for the connection.
 
 If this key is not specified and if the database was previously attached, the database will not be reattached. The previously attached database will be used as the default database for the connection.
 
 If this key is specified together with the AttachDBFileName key, the value of this key will be used as the alias. However, if the name is already used in another attached database, the connection will fail.
 
 The path may be absolute or relative by using the DataDirectory substitution string. If DataDirectory is used, the database file must exist within a subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the substitution string. **Note:**  Remote server, HTTP, and UNC path names are not supported. 
 
 The database name must be specified with the keyword 'database' (or one of its aliases) as in the following:
 
 `"AttachDbFileName=&#124;DataDirectory&#124;\data\YourDB.mdf;integrated security=true;database=YourDatabase"`
 
 An error will be generated if a log file exists in the same directory as the data file and the 'database' keyword is used when attaching the primary data file. In this case, remove the log file. Once the database is attached, a new log file will be automatically generated based on the physical path.  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a new <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> instance, and sets the `AttachDBFilename` property in order to specify the name of an attached data file.

## Remarks  
 This property corresponds to the "Data Source", "server", "address", "addr", and "network address" keys within the connection string. Regardless of which of these values has been supplied within the supplied connection string, the connection string created by the `SqlConnectionStringBuilder` will use the well-known "Data Source" key.  
  
The port number can be specified after the server name: `server=tcp:servername, portnumber`.

When specifying a local instance, always use (local). To force a protocol, add one of the following prefixes:`np:(local),  tcp:(local), lpc:(local)`.

You can also connect to a LocalDB database as follows: `server=(localdb)\\myInstance`. For more information about LocalDB, see [SqlClient Support for LocalDB](/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/sqlclient-support-localdb).
**Data Source** must use the TCP format or the Named Pipes format. TCP format is as follows:

-   tcp:\<host name>\\<instance name\>
-   tcp:\<host name>,\<TCP/IP port number>

The TCP format must start with the prefix "tcp:" and is followed by the database instance, as specified by a host name and an instance name. This format is not applicable when connecting to Azure SQL Database. TCP is automatically selected for connections to Azure SQL Database when no protocol is specified.

The host name MUST be specified in one of the following ways:
-   NetBIOSName
-   IPv4Address
-   IPv6Address

The instance name is used to resolve to a particular TCP/IP port number on which a database instance is hosted. Alternatively, specifying a TCP/IP port number directly is also allowed. If both instance name and port number are not present, the default database instance is used.

The Named Pipes format is as follows:
-   np:\\\\<host name\>\pipe\\<pipe name\>

The Named Pipes format MUST start with the prefix "np:" and is followed by a named pipe name.

The host name MUST be specified in one of the following ways:

-   NetBIOSName
-   IPv4Address
-   IPv6Address

The pipe name is used to identify the database instance to which the .NET application will connect. 

If the value of the **Network** key is specified, the prefixes "tcp:" and "np:" should not be specified. **Note:**  You can force the use of TCP instead of shared memory, either by prefixing **tcp:** to the server name in the connection string, or by using **localhost**.

## Remarks  
 This property corresponds to the "Encrypt" key within the connection string.  
  
When `TrustServerCertificate` is false and `Encrypt` is <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionEncryptOption.Mandatory%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionEncryptOption.Strict%2A> or `true`, the server name (or IP address) in a server's TLS certificate must exactly match the server name (or IP address) specified in the connection string. Otherwise, the connection attempt will fail. For information about support for certificates whose subject starts with a wildcard character (*), see [Enable encrypted connections to the Database Engine](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine#certificate-requirements).  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from **version 4.0**, the default value of the property `Encrypt` is set to `true` while it is `false` for earlier versions.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from **version 5.0**, the data type is updated to <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionEncryptOption>, and the default value of the `Encrypt` property is set to <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionEncryptOption.Mandatory%2A>.

 This property corresponds to the "Load Balance Timeout" and "connection lifetime" keys within the connection string.  
  
When a connection is returned to the pool, its creation time is compared with the current time, and the connection is destroyed if that time span (in seconds) exceeds the value specified by `Connection Lifetime`. This is useful in clustered configurations to force load balancing between a running server and a server just brought online.

A value of zero (0) causes pooled connections to have the maximum connection timeout.

## Remarks  
 This property corresponds to the "Pool Blocking Period" key within the connection string.
 
 When connection pooling is enabled and a timeout error or other login error occurs, an exception will be thrown and subsequent connection attempts will fail for the next five seconds, the "blocking period". If the application attempts to connect within the blocking period, the first exception will be thrown again. Subsequent failures after a blocking period ends will result in a new blocking period that is twice as long as the previous blocking period, up to a maximum of one minute.  
  
 Attempting to connect to Azure SQL databases can fail with transient errors which are typically recovered within a few seconds. However, with the connection pool blocking period behavior, you may not be able to reach your database for extensive periods even though the database is  available. This is especially problematic for apps that need to render fast. The **PoolBlockingPeriod** enables you to select the blocking period best suited for your app. See the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.PoolBlockingPeriod> enumeration for available settings.

 Because the **Remove** method returns a value that indicates its success, it is not required to look for a key before trying to remove the key/value pair from the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> instance. Because the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> maintains a fixed-size collection of key/value pairs, calling the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder.Remove%2A> method simply resets the value of the key/value pair back to its default value.  
  
 Because the collection of keys supported by the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> is fixed, every item within the collection has a known default value. The following table lists the keys, and the value for each when the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> is first initialized, or after the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder.Remove%2A> method has been called.  
  
|Key|Default value|  
|---------|-------------------|  
|Application Name|"Framework Microsoft SqlClient Data Provider" when running on .NET Framework. "Core Microsoft SqlClient Data Provider" otherwise.|  
|AttachDBFilename|Empty string|  
|Connection Timeout|15|  
|Context Connection(Obsolete)|False|  
|Current Language|Empty string|  
|Data Source|Empty string|  
|Encrypt|False in versions prior to 4.0, True in versions 4.0 and up|  
|Enlist|True|

|Integrated Security|False|  
|Load Balance Timeout|0|  
|Max Pool Size|100|  
|Min Pool Size|0|  
|MultipleActiveResultSets|False|

|User Instance|False|  
|Workstation ID|Empty string|  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example converts an existing connection string from using Windows Authentication to using integrated security. The example works by removing the user name and password from the connection string, and then setting the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder.IntegratedSecurity%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> object.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This example includes a password to demonstrate how <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> works with connection strings. In your applications, we recommend that you use Windows Authentication. If you must use a password, do not include a hard-coded password in your application.  
  
 [!code-csharp[SqlConnectionStringBuilder_Remove#1](~/../sqlclient/doc/samples/SqlConnectionStringBuilder_Remove.cs#1)]
  
 The example displays the following text in the console window:  
  
```  
Original: Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;User ID=ab;Password=********  
Modified: Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=True

|Implicit Unbind|The default. Causes the connection to detach from the transaction when it ends. After detaching, additional requests on the connection are performed in autocommit mode. The <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A> property is not checked when executing requests while the transaction is active. After the transaction has ended, additional requests are performed in autocommit mode.|  
|Explicit Unbind|Causes the connection to remain attached to the transaction until the connection is closed or until <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.EnlistTransaction%2A> is called with a `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic) value. An <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown if <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A> is not the enlisted transaction or if the enlisted transaction is not active. This behavior enforces the strict scoping rules required for <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> support.|

 If the `Failover Partner` key is set, `Transparent Network IP Resolution` is ignored.  
  
 The value of this key must be `true`, `false`, `yes`, or `no`.  
  
 A value of `yes` is treated the same as a value of `true`.

## Remarks  
 This property corresponds to the "Trust Server Certificate" and "TrustServerCertificate" keys within the connection string.  

 When `Trust Server Certificate` is set to `true`, the transport layer will use TLS to encrypt the channel and bypass walking the certificate chain to validate trust. If `Trust Server Certificate` is set to `true` and encryption is enforced by target server, the encryption level specified on the server will be used even if `Encrypt` is set to `false`. The connection will fail otherwise.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder.TryGetValue%2A> method lets developers safely retrieve a value from a <xref:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> without needing to verify that the supplied key name is a valid key name. Because **TryGetValue** does not raise an exception when you call it, passing in a nonexistent key, you do not have to look for a key before retrieving its value.  Calling **TryGetValue** with a nonexistent key will place the value null (`Nothing` in Visual Basic) in the `value` parameter.
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the behavior of the **TryGetValue** method.  
  
 [!code-csharp[SqlConnectionStringBuilder_TryGetValue#1](~/../sqlclient/doc/samples/SqlConnectionStringBuilder_TryGetValue.cs#1)]
  
 The sample displays the following results:
