> The `RetryLogic` property is assigned at `SqlRetryLogicBaseProvider` creation and its value is used as a template internally. Don't use it to monitor the status of the retry logic during and after execution. Instead, use the <xref=E:Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlRetryLogicBaseProvider.Retrying> event to collect data about retry executions.
