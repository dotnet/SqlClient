# Release Notes

## Stable Release 6.1.0 - 2025-08-05

This update brings the following changes since the
[6.0.2](../6.0/6.0.2.md) stable release:

### Added

#### Added dedicated SQL Server vector datatype support

*What Changed:*

- Optimized vector communications between MDS and SQL Server 2025, employing a
  custom binary format over the TDS protocol.
  ([#3433](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3433),
   [#3443](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3443))
- Reduced processing load compared to existing JSON-based vector support.
- Initial support for 32-bit single-precision floating point vectors.

*Who Benefits:*

- Applications moving large vector data sets will see beneficial improvements
  to processing times and memory requirements.
- Vector-specific APIs are ready to support future numeric representations with
  a consistent look-and-feel.

*Impact:*

- Reduced transmission and processing times for vector operations versus JSON
  using SQL Server 2025 preview:
  - Reads:  50x improvement
  - Writes: 3.3x improvement
  - Bulk Copy: 19x improvement
  - (Observed with vector column of max 1998 size, and 10,000 records for each
    operation.)
- Improved memory footprint due to the elimination of JSON
  serialization/deserialization and string representation bloat.
- For backwards compatibility with earlier SQL Server Vector implementations,
  applications may continue to use JSON strings to send/receive vector data,
  although they will not see any of the performance improvements noted above.

#### Revived .NET Standard 2.0 target support

*What Changed:*

- Support for targeting .NET Standard 2.0 has returned.
  ([#3381](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3381))
- Support had previously been removed in the 6.0 release, with the
  [community voicing concerns](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/discussions/3115).

*Who Benefits:*

- Libraries that depend on MDS may seamlessly target any of the following
  frameworks:
  - .NET Standard 2.0
  - .NET Framework 4.6.2 and above
  - .NET 8.0
  - .NET 9.0
- Applications should continue to target runtimes.
  - The MDS .NET Standard 2.0 target framework support does not include an
    actual implementation, and cannot be used with a runtime.
  - An application's build/publish process should always pick the appropriate
    MDS .NET/.NET Framework runtime implementation.
  - Custom build/publish actions that incorrectly try to deploy the MDS .NET
    Standard 2.0 reference DLL at runtime are not supported.

*Impact:*

- Libraries targeting .NET Standard 2.0 will no longer receive warnings like
  this:
  - `warning NU1701: Package 'Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 6.0.2' was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.6.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8.1' instead of the project target framework '.NETStandard,Version=v2.0'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project.`

#### Other Additions

- Added packet multiplexing support to improve large data read performance.
  ([#2714](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/2714),
   [#3161](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3161),
   [#3202](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3202))
- Added support for special casing with Fabric endpoints.
  ([#3084](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3084))

  ([#3474](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3474))

  ([#3500](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3500))

### Changed

#### SqlDecimal type workarounds conversions

*What Changed:*

- Changed how SqlDecimal type workarounds perform conversions to meet
  compliance policies.
  ([#3467](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3467))

*Who Benefits:*

- Microsoft products must not use undocumented APIs on other Microsoft products.
  This change removes calls to undocumented APIs and replaces them with
  compliant API use.

*Impact:*

- These changes impose an observed 5% decrease in performance on .NET Framework.

#### SqlVector API improvements (since [6.1.0-preview2](6.1.0-preview2.md))

*What Changed:*

- Several changes were made to the SqlVector API published in the
  [6.1.0-preview2](6.1.0-preview2.md) release
  ([#3472](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/3472)):
  - The SqlVector class was changed to a readonly struct.
  - The null value constructor was changed to a static `CreateNull()` method.
  - The `Size` property was removed.

*Who Benefits:*

- SqlVector instances gain the efficiencies of struct handling.

*Impact:*

- Early-adopter applications may require updates if they rely on the old APIs
  and any class-specific behaviour.
