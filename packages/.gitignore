# The packages/ directory must exist for local development due to the various
# NuGet.config files that refer to it.  However, we never want any files in
# this directory to be included in source control.
#
# Git doesn't track directories, only files, so we need this .gitignore file
# to force Git into tracking the packages/ directory itself.

# Ignore everything in this directory
*

# Except this file
!.gitignore
